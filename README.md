This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving implicit type coercion with the addition operator. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version. The issue arises when using the '+' operator with mixed data types, leading to string concatenation rather than numerical addition. The solution employs explicit type checking and conversion to ensure consistent numerical operations, thereby preventing unexpected behavior.
